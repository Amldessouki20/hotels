# Hotel Management Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed step-by-step plan to update the Hotel model in the Prisma schema, create RESTful API endpoints, and integrate them with the frontend hotel management page.

## Current Analysis

### Frontend Requirements (from hotel/page.tsx)
The hotel interface currently uses these fields:
- `id`: string (unique identifier)
- `name`: string (primary hotel name)
- `code`: string (hotel code like 'GPH001')
- `altName`: string (alternative/Arabic name)
- `address`: string (hotel address)
- `createdAt`: string (creation date)

### Current Prisma Schema Issues
The current Hotel model has many additional fields that are not used in the frontend:
- `description`, `city`, `country`, `phone`, `email`, `rating` - not used in frontend
- Missing `altDescription` field that should be added
- Relations with `createdBy`, `rooms`, `bookings`, `amenities` should be preserved

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Analyze Current Hotel Model ✅
**Status**: Pending
**Description**: Thoroughly analyze the current Hotel model in the Prisma schema to understand existing relations and dependencies.

**Tasks**:
- Review current Hotel model fields
- Identify which fields are used in frontend vs backend
- Document all existing relations that must be preserved
- Note any potential breaking changes

**Validation**: 
- [ ] All current Hotel model fields documented
- [ ] All relations identified and documented
- [ ] Frontend-backend field mapping completed

**Note**: Recheck code after this step to ensure no errors and correct understanding.

### Step 2: Update Hotel Model in Prisma Schema ✅
**Status**: Pending
**Description**: Update the Hotel model to match frontend requirements while preserving existing relations.

**Required Fields**:
- `id`: String @id @default(cuid())
- `name`: String (hotel name)
- `altName`: String (alternative hotel name)
- `code`: String @unique (hotel code)
- `description`: String? (hotel description)
- `altDescription`: String? (alternative hotel description)
- `address`: String (hotel address)
- `createdAt`: DateTime @default(now())
- `updatedAt`: DateTime @updatedAt
- `createdById`: String (for relation)

**Relations to Preserve**:
- `createdBy`: User relation
- `rooms`: Room[] relation
- `bookings`: Booking[] relation
- `amenities`: HotelAmenity[] relation

**Tasks**:
- Remove unused fields: `city`, `country`, `phone`, `email`, `rating`, `isActive`
- Add `altDescription` field
- Ensure all relations remain intact
- Update schema file
- Generate Prisma client

**Validation**:
- [ ] Schema updated with correct fields
- [ ] All relations preserved
- [ ] Prisma client generated successfully
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing relations

**Note**: Recheck code after this step to ensure schema is valid and no errors exist.

### Step 3: Create RESTful API Endpoints ✅
**Status**: Pending
**Description**: Create comprehensive CRUD API endpoints for Hotel management.

**Endpoint Structure**: `/api/hotels`

**Required Endpoints**:
1. `GET /api/hotels` - Get all hotels with filtering
2. `GET /api/hotels/[id]` - Get single hotel by ID
3. `POST /api/hotels` - Create new hotel
4. `PUT /api/hotels/[id]` - Update existing hotel
5. `DELETE /api/hotels/[id]` - Delete hotel
6. `DELETE /api/hotels` - Bulk delete hotels

**Features**:
- Input validation using Zod schemas
- Error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- Support for filtering by name and code
- Pagination support
- Bulk operations support
- Optimized for future modifications

**Files to Create**:
- `/src/app/api/hotels/route.ts` (GET, POST, DELETE bulk)
- `/src/app/api/hotels/[id]/route.ts` (GET, PUT, DELETE single)
- `/src/lib/validations/hotel.ts` (Zod schemas)
- `/src/lib/api-utils.ts` (utility functions)

**Validation**:
- [ ] All CRUD endpoints implemented
- [ ] Input validation working
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Filtering and pagination working
- [ ] API tested with sample requests

**Note**: Recheck code after this step to ensure all endpoints work correctly and handle errors properly.

### Step 4: Update Frontend to Use API Endpoints ✅
**Status**: Pending
**Description**: Replace local state management in hotel page with API calls.

**Changes Required**:
- Remove hardcoded hotels array
- Implement API service functions
- Add loading states and error handling
- Update CRUD operations to use API
- Add proper form validation
- Implement optimistic updates where appropriate

**API Integration**:
- `fetchHotels()` - Load hotels from API
- `createHotel()` - Create new hotel via API
- `updateHotel()` - Update hotel via API
- `deleteHotel()` - Delete single hotel via API
- `deleteMultipleHotels()` - Bulk delete via API

**UI Enhancements**:
- Loading spinners during API calls
- Error messages for failed operations
- Success notifications
- Form validation feedback
- Optimistic UI updates

**Files to Modify**:
- `/src/app/(owner)/hotel/page.tsx`
- Create `/src/lib/api/hotels.ts` (API service functions)
- Create `/src/hooks/useHotels.ts` (custom hook for hotel operations)

**Validation**:
- [ ] All CRUD operations working through API
- [ ] Loading states implemented
- [ ] Error handling working
- [ ] Form validation active
- [ ] UI responsive and user-friendly

**Note**: Recheck code after this step to ensure frontend integrates properly with API and handles all edge cases.

### Step 5: Update Seed File ✅
**Status**: Pending
**Description**: Update the seed.js file to reflect the new Hotel model structure.

**Changes Required**:
- Remove fields: `city`, `country`, `phone`, `email`, `rating`, `isActive`
- Add `altDescription` field to hotel creation
- Ensure seed data matches new schema
- Update sample data to be more realistic

**Sample Data Updates**:
- Add meaningful `altDescription` values
- Ensure `description` and `altDescription` are properly set
- Maintain existing hotel codes and names for consistency
- Keep relations intact (createdById, etc.)

**Validation**:
- [ ] Seed file updated with new schema
- [ ] All required fields included
- [ ] Sample data is realistic and useful
- [ ] Seed runs without errors
- [ ] Database populated correctly

**Note**: Recheck code after this step to ensure seed file works correctly with updated schema.

---

### Step 6: Testing and Validation ✅
**Status**: Pending
**Description**: Comprehensive testing of all implemented features.

**Testing Areas**:
1. **Database Schema**:
   - Prisma migrations work correctly
   - All relations preserved
   - Data integrity maintained

2. **API Endpoints**:
   - All CRUD operations functional
   - Input validation working
   - Error handling proper
   - Response formats correct

3. **Frontend Integration**:
   - All UI operations work with API
   - Loading states display correctly
   - Error messages show appropriately
   - Form validation active

4. **Data Flow**:
   - Create hotel flow works end-to-end
   - Update hotel flow works end-to-end
   - Delete hotel flow works end-to-end
   - Bulk operations work correctly
   - Filtering and search functional

**Test Cases**:

- [ ] Update existing hotel
- [ ] Delete single hotel
- [ ] Bulk delete multiple hotels
- [ ] Filter hotels by name
- [ ] Filter hotels by code
